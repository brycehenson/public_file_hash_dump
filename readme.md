This git contains some hashes of files which I would like to prove I had on this date.

I would love if there was a better solution to this problem of proving that you have a file at some time.
Will also investigate putting on blockchains.


# Crypto solutions
- [privatestamp](https://github.com/mustafarefaey/PrivateStamp)
- [origin stamp](https://originstamp.com/) seems like a pretty good solution but if the company goes under so does the proof. Maybe the hash directory can be downloaded.

# public publish solutions
publish the hash on a public form that would take substantial effort to modify.
- twitter
